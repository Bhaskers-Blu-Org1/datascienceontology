description: >
  A linear support vector machine for classification or regression.
  
  Linear SVMs are exponential family linear models, analogous to logistic
  regression, but fit by mimimizing constraint violations to inequalities
  between likelihood ratios, rather than by maximizing the likelihood (see Mark
  Schmidt's 2009 paper "A note on structural extensions of SVMs").

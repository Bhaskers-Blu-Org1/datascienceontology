name: exponential family linear model
description: >
  Any supervised, parametric model based on an exponential family of probability
  distributions, whose prediction function (natural parameter) is linear. This
  is a very large family of models, especially since we admit models that are
  not fit by (penalized) maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation.
